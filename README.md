Imprudence client for Tritium
 ABOUT T-IMP

	This is a version of the old Imprudence viewer with modifications
	for it to communicate with the Tritium client. It is based on
    the meta-impy viewer by OneFang, from the Imprudence 1.4 viewer.
	Contact Kitto Flora on SL, or kittoflora@gmail.com for more information.

	This source was originally built on Ubuntu 10.10.
	As of May 2017 it would not build on Xubuntu 16.04, but that is the
	target system.
